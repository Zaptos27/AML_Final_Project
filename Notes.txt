Odysseas:
    Band energy ratio: 
        Comparison of energy in the lower/higher frequency bands
        Measurment of how dominanant low frequencies are
        We define a split frequencies. It is completely arbitrary (reasonable value 2000Hz)
        Specifically used to descriminate music from speach, define music genre
        It is calculated as the squared sum of the aplitudes for each low and high frequencys and taking the ratio
    Spectral Centroid:
        Center of gravityof the magnitude spectrum. Frequency band in which we have most of the energy concentrated
        Measure of brightness
        Used for Audio/Sound Classification
    Bandwidth:
        Derived from spectral centroid
        Spectral range around the centroid
        Variance from the spectral centroid
        It is the weighted mean of the distances of frequency bands from SC
        Used for music genre classification
